  <body><b>Leader
Election Algorithm:<o:p></o:p></b>

<p class="">The leader election
solution was first thought of at the end of the seventies. To date network
topologies and wireless networks are still being studied. Later on in nineties
meshes, hypercube and tree were studied. In the study of trees and graphs at
that time the problem of link failure must have occurred, which would result
into the system failure.&nbsp; So researchers
might have thought of some kind of solution to that problem which would result
into the system recovery. The main idea for proposing a solution could be that
researchers gave thought to get rid of additional configuration, add some kind
of flexibility, and stability of the whole system.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""><strong>But now the question
that arises is Why Leader Election Algorithm??? </strong>The Leader could be elected
manually as well then why the need occurred to design Leader Election
Algorithm. Suppose our manual leader selection algorithm is quiet easy as we
can get the list of available systems and select the one with the highest IP
address. But what when Leader result into the some kind of failure??? The
answer is <strong>LEADER ELECTION Algorithm</strong> having a leader in a dynamic system.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="">For example consider a
network of nodes, where it is vital to have one leader node at all times. If
the current leader dies, then the network has to choose another leader. Given
this scenario and requirement there are two possible ways to do it.</p>

<ol start="1" type="1"><li class="">The central system approach, where
     there is a central node deciding who will be the leader. If the current
     leader dies, then this central node will decide on who should take over
     the leader role. But this is single point of failure means if central node
     which is responsible for deciding the leader goes down then there is no
     one there to select leaders if the current leader dies.<o:p></o:p></li><li class="">Where as in the same scenario we
     can use distributed leader election, as in this all the nodes come to a
     consensus which the leader should be. So we do not need to have a central
     node who decides on who the leader should be, hence eliminating the single
     point of failure. When the leader node dies, then there will be a way to
     detect node failure, and then every node will start a distributed leader election
     algorithm, and mutually come to a consensus of electing a leader.<o:p></o:p></li></ol>

<p class="">So, in short when you
have a system which has no central control, probably because the system is
meant to be scalable without having single point of failure, in those systems
to take choose some node, leader elections algorithms can work better.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="">Now we can take an
example of a network with a hypercube topology to understand how Distributed
Leader Election Algorithm works does.&nbsp; In
this topology, every node has exactly N neighbours (where N is the hyper cubeâ€™s
dimension). Since the hypercube is&nbsp;<i>oriented</i>, the nodes know which
of their links corresponds to every dimension. Also, I assume that all nodes
are labelled with some unique id, as typical with this kind of problems.</p><p class=""><br></p><p class=""><br></p><p class=""><br></p><p class=""><br></p><p class=""><br></p>
